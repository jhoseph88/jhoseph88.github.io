# jhoseph88.github.io

This is a simple rendition of Conway's Game of Life. As I have used this repository for personal website projects and experiments in the past, the index.html file is the only file relevant to the Conway's Game of Life simulation. 

To use, simply type 'jhoseph88.github.io' into your address bar and add the initial probability of a given cell being "on" or "alive." Then, click "Ok" to begin the simulation.
